你好，我是崔秦毓，目前就读于深圳大学[建筑与城市规划学院](https://saup.szu.edu.cn/)城市规划专业。 我的研究兴趣是在城市规划研究中融合计算机科学和数据科学学科的方法，目前正在进行新能源产业和街景感知领域相关的综述和实证研究。

## 我的背景和历史
我本科在兰州理工大学城乡规划专业学习，毕业后推免至深圳大学城市规划专业攻读硕士学位。在本科阶段，我主要学习的是规划设计，但在一次社会实践调研竞赛中，我了解到城乡规划专业并不是完全只有设计方向，还包含了融合多个学科知识的研究方向。例如，社会学中的问卷调查、地理学中的ArcGIS操作和分析、经济学中的商业布局和统计学中的回归分析等。在这一过程中我领略到了科研的魅力，喜欢上了这种有逻辑、科学和有趣的内容。于是，我本科毕业后加入深圳大学开始真正的进入城乡规划的科研领域。

## 我的研究经历
I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to holistically investigate socio-technical systems of technology and knowledge production. I have a particular focus on decentralized communities and institutions, such as open source software, scientific research, peer production platforms (like Wikipedia), and social media sites. Most of my previous work has focused on [Wikipedia](http://enwp.org/Wikipedia), where I've studied the people and algorithms that produce and maintain an open encyclopedia. I’ve also studied scientific research networks and projects, including the [Long-Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), the [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/), and the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments](http://msdse.org/). I study topics including newcomer socialization, cooperation and conflict, community governance, specialization and professionalization, information verification and quality control, hackathons and community workshops, the roles of support staff and technicians, bias and discrimination, and diversity and inclusion. I also often focus on how these issues all intersect with and are embedded in the design of software and automated systems.

## My intellectual communities
I’m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like computer science, information science, social psychology, and organization/management science with fields like philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and history of science and technology. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and new media / internet studies. Methodologically, while I am trained as a qualitative ethnographer, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.
