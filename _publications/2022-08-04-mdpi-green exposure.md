Exposure to green spaces contributes to residents’ physical and mental health and well-being. The equitable allocation of green space has also become an increasingly important issue for society and the government. This study takes 3281 communities in Shenzhen as the analysis units. Using web crawlers, semantic segmentation based on deep learning, web map path planning and entropy weighting methods, four types of residents’ daily green exposure indicators are calculated,
including community green space ratio, green view index (GVI), park accessibility, and the weighted composite green exposure index. The results reveal inequalities in the level of green exposure in Shenzhen’s communities across economic classes, mainly in GVI and comprehensive green exposure. We also found that the level of composite green exposure is relatively stable; however, green space ratio attainment levels for newer communities are increasing and GVI and park accessibility attainment levels are decreasing. Finally, among the newly built communities: compared to the low-income level communities, the high-income level communities have a significant advantage in green space, but the mid-income level communities do not have such an advantage. The main findings of this study can provide policy implications for urban green space planning, including the need to prioritize the addition of public green space near older communities with poor levels of green exposure, the addition of street greenery near communities with poor levels of composite green exposure, and ensuring that parks have entrances in all four directions as far as possible.
