Abstract: The strategic deployment of public electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) is imperative for achieving transportation decarbonization. While EVCS accessibility is a critical factor influencing user experience and the adoption of electric vehicles, prior assessments have evaluated EVCS accessibility solely based on residential locations, overlooking the actual daily mobility patterns of vehicle owners. This oversight may result in an underestimate of potential charging opportunities. So this study uses home-workplace (H-W) location data derived from mobile phone records to reevaluate EVCS accessibility and its associated equity status. We employed the Gaussian two-step floating catchment area (G2SFCA) to calculate accessibility at both workplace and residential locations and aggregated residents’ EVCS accessibility at the residential location. The results indicate that: (1) accessibility improved for 99.94% of residents, with 21.64% experiencing an average reduction of 627.67 m in travel distance to EVCS; (2) equity in EVCS accessibility markedly increased, evidenced by a reduction in the Gini coefficient from 0.49 to 0.26; (3) the underlying drivers of the proposed dual-perspective accessibility index reveal that “GDP”, “Building density”, “Traffic flow”, and “Distance to the nearest subway station” show high feature importance scores. Specifically, the home scenario model is also significantly influenced by “Housing age” and “Shopping facilities”, while “Distance to the nearest primary road” and “Plot ratio” are key drivers in the workplace scenario. The findings can help alleviate (potential) consumers’ charging anxiety and encourage planners to shift their focus to areas with low EVCS accessibility from both home and workplace. Additionally, the proposed methodology provides actionable insights and can be adapted for broader urban accessibility studies.
